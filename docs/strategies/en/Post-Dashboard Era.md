# Overarching Argument

SaaS products are evolving from **“dashboards”** (user-driven interfaces for monitoring and manual action) to **“doers”** (AI-powered, autonomous agents that perform tasks on the user’s behalf). This shift is driven by technological advancements and changes the fundamental value proposition, design principles, and strategic landscape for SaaS companies.

---

## I. The Fundamental Shift: From “Informing” to “Acting”

### Argument 1 – Traditional SaaS (*Dashboard Era*) is informational and manual

* **Premise 1a:** Dashboards are visual interfaces where users monitor data.
* **Premise 1b:** Users must manually decide on and execute actions, often outside the software or via extra steps.
* **Conclusion 1:** The primary value lies in presenting information for human decision-making.

### Argument 2 – Post-Dashboard SaaS (*Doer Era*) is autonomous and action-oriented

* **Premise 2a:** “Doers” are agentic, event-driven services that autonomously take action.
* **Premise 2b:** The software *does it for you* rather than merely advising how.
* **Conclusion 2:** Value shifts to the software performing tasks and delivering outcomes.

### Argument 3 – Converging technology trends enable the shift

* **Premise 3a:** Advanced AI and workflow automation handle complex, multi-step tasks without constant human guidance.
* **Premise 3b:** *Example:* Nadella’s Copilot orchestrates actions across CRM and Office 365 to present answers or trigger next steps.
* **Conclusion 3:** Technology now makes autonomous “doer” SaaS both feasible and powerful.

### Argument 4 – Changing user role and locus of value

* **Premise 4a:** In the “doer” model, users set goals and oversee results; they no longer perform operational steps.
* **Premise 4b:** Consequently, value is created in the back-end (integrations, decision logic, automation) rather than UI polish.
* **Conclusion 4:** The interface becomes a minimal *control layer* while true differentiation lies in back-end automation.

## II. Principles Defining Successful “Doer” SaaS

*(Necessary conditions for post-dashboard products)*

| -- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5  | **Automation-First Design**              | 5a. Default experience = end-to-end execution · 5b. Manual step-driven tools remain dashboards                     | Necessary                                    | Software must take initiative; value is in actions, not screens.            |
| 6  | **Native Data Integration**              | 6a. “Doers” orchestrate multiple tools/data · 6b. Requires deep, native integrations                               | Necessary (and sufficient for orchestration) | “Agent-friendly” APIs are essential; isolated apps cannot automate smartly. |
| 7  | **Adaptive Pricing Models**              | 7a. Per-seat pricing misaligned when humans aren’t the actors · 7b. Usage/outcome pricing aligns cost to work done | Mandated                                     | Pricing should reflect automation’s value, potentially free until results.  |
| 8  | **Domain-Specializable Workflows**       | 8a. Generic agents struggle with nuance · 8b. Domain knowledge ensures correct automation                          | Often Necessary                              | Verticalization or high customizability ensures context-aware actions.      |
| 9  | **Continuous Evaluation & Learning**     | 9a. Unmonitored autonomy risks silent errors · 9b. Feedback loops drive adaptation and trust                       | Essential                                    | “Doers” must learn from outcomes to improve over time.                      |
| 10 | **Composability & Modular Architecture** | 10a. “Doers” operate inside larger workflows · 10b. Must expose modular functionality                              | Necessary                                    | SaaS must be pluggable to stay relevant in an agent-driven ecosystem.       |
| 11 | **Low-Friction Onboarding & Adoption**   | 11a. Value should arrive quickly · 11b. Agent model shifts setup burden to the machine                             | Expected                                     | Ease of adoption and rapid time-to-value become competitive necessities.    |

## III. Strategic Implications of the Post-Dashboard Shift

### Argument 12 – Early movers gain defensible advantages

* **Premise 12a:** They define categories and standards.
* **Premise 12b:** They accumulate data and integration depth that form moats.
* **Conclusion 12:** Substantial first-mover opportunity exists for genuinely autonomous solutions.

### Argument 13 – Legacy SaaS faces an innovator’s dilemma but can adapt

* **Premise 13a:** Reduced UI interaction threatens existing models.
* **Premise 13b:** Incumbents possess data, integrations, and trust.
* **Premise 13c:** Adaptation paths: build/integrate copilots, open APIs, acquire startups, re-architect for automation.
* **Conclusion 13:** Incumbents must evolve into “doers” or risk commoditization/bypass.

### Argument 14 – Greenfield opportunities and new markets emerge

* **Premise 14a:** “Doer” SaaS tackles domains unsuited to complex dashboards.
* **Premise 14b:** Solutions can automate end-to-end workflows, replacing manual labor or fragmented tools.
* **Premise 14c:** New meta-services/orchestration layers become possible.

* **Premise 15b:** Users prefer the convenience and efficiency of autonomous agents.
* **Conclusion 15:** SaaS products must automate to stay competitive; the post-dashboard era is inevitable.

### Argument 16 – The shift amplifies human potential

* **Premise 16a:** “Doer” SaaS handles mundane, repetitive tasks.
* **Premise 16b:** Humans are freed for higher-level creativity, strategy, and oversight.
* **Conclusion 16:** Though technologically driven, the post-dashboard era ultimately serves a human-centric goal.
